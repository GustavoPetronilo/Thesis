# PhD Dissertation Thesis

## Overview
This repository contains my PhD Dissertation Thesis, which explores a formulation of Symplectic Quantum Mechanics 
using Galilean Covariant Tensor Formalism.

## Abstract
This work investigates the notion of a conformal group and derives a representation
for symplectic quantum mechanics in the Galilean manifold, G, in a consistent manner
using the Wigner function method. We study two non-Lorentzian conformal symmetries:
the Conformal Carrollian group and the Schödinger group. A symplectic Hilbert space
is built and unitary operators representing translations and rotations are studied, whose
generators fulfill the Lie algebra in G. The Schr¨odinger (Klein-Gordon-like) equation for
the wave functions in phase space is derived from this representation, where the variables
have the contents of position and linear momentum. By means of the Moyal product,
wave functions are linked to the Wigner function, so symbolizing a quasi-amplitude of
probability. We establish the explicitly covariant form of the Levy-Leblond (Dirac-like)
equation in phase-space. In conclusion, we demonstrate how the five-dimensional phase-
space formalism and the standard formalism are equivalent. We next provide a solution
that restores the standard (non-covariant) form of the Pauli-Schr¨odinger problem in phase-
space. We investigate the non-relativistic part of the Stefan-Boltzmann law and the Casimir
effect for the spin 0 and spin 1/2 particles with thermofield dynamics, also within the
framework of Galilean covariance.
